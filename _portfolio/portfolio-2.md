**Project Goals**: Forecasting energy consumption is vital for optimizing energy generation, enhancing planning, operation, management, and efficient use of energy systems, and boosting the energy market. In this project, we will utilize historical data of monthly electricity consumption to forecast future demand.

**Learning Objective:**
•	Exploring time series data
•	Build machine learning model
•	Time Series Forecasting models
