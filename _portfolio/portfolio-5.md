title: "Identify faces with images Neural Network models"
excerpt: " Predict Gender of images using Neural Network models."
collection: portfolio
---

**Problem Statement:**
This project introduces the application of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for detecting human faces in images to provide a classifciation model that accurately predicts Genders. These models could be used for complex business problems like counting the attendees at a conference, mask detection or measuring attentiveness of a class.

**Learning Objective:**
<ul>
<li>Understand Neural Network and it's hyperparameters.</li>
<li>Understand Keras models and Face detections.</li>
<li>Learn Image recognition using Python.</li>
</ul>
