title: "Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction"
excerpt: " Predict launch success rates using SVM, KNN & Decision Tree Classifer models." 
collection: portfolio

**Problem Statement:**
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.

**Learning Objective:**
<ul>
<li>Perform exploratory data analysis and determine training labels</li>
<li>Model prediction using SVM, KNN & Decision Tree Classifer.</li>
<li>Hyperparameter tuning for the above models.</li>
</ul>
