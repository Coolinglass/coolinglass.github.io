**Problem Statement:**
Hate speech is prevalent on the Internet, posing a challenge for platforms like Facebook and Twitter in identifying and censoring such content while respecting freedom of speech. This task 
involves detecting hate speech in tweets, with a focus on classifying tweets containing racist or sexist sentiments from others.

**Learning Objective:**
<ul>
<li>Perform HTML parsing and text cleaning using Beautiful Soup library.</li>
<li>Perform data transform using Tokenizer and padding methods.
<li>Understand Neural Networks, RNN and it's hyperparameters.</li>
</ul>
